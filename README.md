In this project I did cohort analysis on online retail data. I downloaded data from link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail 
This is transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. 

Customers are classified into cohorts based on a common attribute, in this case date (year and month) of the initial purchase. This is followed by analyzing and monitoring their behaviour over a period of time to identify trends and patterns that can help business make informed decisions. 

Project included loading data from csv file (convert xlsx after downloading to csv file) to SSMS using SSIS (Visual Studio 2022). After that, dataset is cleaned and analyzed using SQL (all informattion and explanations in SQL_Analysis document). Finally,cleaned and transformed data are visualized using Tableau Desktop.
